# MessengerPlus
An extension that provides additional functionality and visual modes for www.messenger.com.

## How to Use

## Plus Button Customization
The Plus button is located on the top left of the screen and looks like this:


### Light/Dark Mode
This changes the theme of messenger to be light or dark.

### Borders On/Off
This toggles the borders of each section of the page on and off.

### Private mode
When private mode is on, messages and conversations are blurred out or invisible until the mouse hovers over it.

### Compact mode
When compact mode is on, the conversation list will automatically minimize into a list of icons and expands when the mouse hovers over it. This is ideal for smaller screen devices.

## Video embedding
A video link that is recognized will automatically be embedded. Only youtube videos and Twitch clips are recognized right now.

## Pinning and Unpinning a Conversation
- To pin a conversation, click on the settings button on the right side of the conversation on the list, click "Pin conversation".
- To unpin a conversation, click on the "Unpin conversation" in the settings menu of the conversation.

## Other Information
This extension is free and I do not collect any user data, nor will I in the future.

## FAQ
###### The loading page never finishes loading
You might have an older version of messenger, see if [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/messsengerplus-old-versio/neaollicfdeidikoaehophbicpkohjof) extension works.

###### I got a message that says it can't find my pinned conversations
If the pinned conversation hasn't seen activity recently, you might need to message that conversation for MessengerPlus to be able to find it and pin it.

###### A video wasn't correctly embedded
This happens sometimes when the link is formatted in a different way. Unfortunately this is still being worked on and you'll have to click the link to see the video.

##### There's a feature I want or a bug I want to report
